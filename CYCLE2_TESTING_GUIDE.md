## üß™ Permission Testing

### 1. Test Non-Admin Assignment (Should Fail)
First, login as the regular user:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/login/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "john_developer",
    "password": "devpass123"
  }'
```

Then try to assign (should get 403 Forbidden):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/projects/2/assign/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Token USER_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "user_ids": [1]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:** `403 Forbidden`

### 2. Test User Access to Own Projects Only
User should be able to access their own projects but not other users' projects.
